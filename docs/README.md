# `dappbot-types` Typedoc Docs

Running `npm run deploy` triggers autogenerating the documentation from our Typescript source and then syncing that output with the `gh-pages` branch.  You can find the most recent doc deploy at [`eximchain.github.io/dappbot-types`](eximchain.github.io/dappbot-types).  The built files will be output into `docs/build`, which is kept in the `.gitignore`.  This `themeoverride` directory contains a few partials which we override in order to make the output docs more useful.  For more information about theming in Typedoc, check out their docs: https://typedoc.org/guides/themes/
